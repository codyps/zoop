 - zfs recv
   - `-o canmount=noauto`
      - disable automounting recved datasets to allow recving without mount privs
   - `-x mountpoint`
      - when a manual mount occurs, always show up within the inherited path
	from dataset created to hold all backups. avoids mounting backups
	causing mounts to go to weird places
   - `-x overlay`
      - allow mounting over already mounted parts (when set by parent)
   - `-o readonly=on`
      - when mounting, disable writing
      - XXX: consider interaction with multiple mounts. Might prevent directory
	creation preventing mounts.
   - `-x sharesmb`
   - `-x sharenfs`
   - `-F`
   - `-h`
     - recv holds? unclear why we'd need to backup holds
   - `-s`
     - save partial recv
   - `-u`
     - file system that is associated with the received stream is not mounted

   - consider:
     - `-x compression`
       - always compress recv'd data
       - but should we just allow compression from clients to persist?
