 - right now, performance is _poor_ when many filesystems to be backed up exist
   - a few commands are executed per-filesystem on both src & dst
 - sometimes snapshots are deleted after zoop enumerates them but before it
   transfers them. right now this results in a crash. we really should just
   skip the failure and move onto the next. We need to identify that the cause of
   failure is that the snapshot didn't exist, though.
